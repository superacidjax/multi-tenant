= Multi-Tenant

This is a Rails 3.2 Engine to enable multi-tenancy

* currently in-progress and not ready for anything yet.
* it uses Haml because ERB is about as un-Zen as it gets.
* it uses Decent Exposure because exposing instance variables in your view is sloppy design.
* this is an opinionated project and isn't for everyone.
